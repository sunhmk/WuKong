ehcache three tiers:
1、 OnHeapStore:ConcurrentHashMap redefined by ehcache。new initTable ->(Node<K,V>[])new Node<?,?>[n],dynamically increase
2、 OffHeapStore:first alocate a list of bytebuffer by OffHeapBufferSource->ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(size). then when used, 
    use the allocated buffer,and record in aatreeset.a buffer can be used by mutile block.for example, a 100 bytebuffer,40 
    for one ,60 for another.OffHeapStorageArea manages allocated bytebuffer,and reflects to pages. 
3、 OffHeapDiskStore
